## Inspiration
Our team wanted to focus on the mental health aspect of hospice and at-home care, where relationships and human interaction are essential but often absent. Rather than prescriptions and machines, our team believes the best way to promote recovery is to make the patient enjoy life and want to keep up with treatments.

## What it does
With its user-friendly interface and cheerful marshmallow mascot, MoodMallow gently checks in throughout the day, helping you express how you're feeling. 
- Track your moods with easy to use buttons, one for positive one for negative
- MoodMallow will generate personal insights on the patient based on mood times (ie, lots of negative emotions near 6pm could suggest digestive issues)
- The administrator page allows hospital staff to see all patients information, with graphs to showcase data and insights using llama 3.1
- Easy to use Chatbot allows patients to ask questions about their health

## Built with
Python, Flask, React, llama 3.1
